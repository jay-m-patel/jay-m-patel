# Jay Patel

**Full-Stack Software Engineer**  
TypeScript · Next.js · React · MongoDB · Express.js

I design and build scalable, maintainable web applications with a strong focus on clean architecture, ownership, and long-term sustainability.

## Engineering mindset

I started my technical journey in **Electrical Machines and Power Electronics**, which shaped a systems-first way of thinking — understanding flows, constraints, failure modes, and efficiency.

That foundation strongly influences how I design software today:  
clear boundaries, predictable behavior, and scalable structures.

## Public work

Most professional work lives in private repositories due to client confidentiality.

Public repositories here represent:
- Reusable foundations
- Learning-driven explorations
- Clean reference implementations

<!-- **Highlighted repository** -->
[`express-boilerplate`](https://github.com/jay-m-patel/express-boilerplate): A reusable Express.js + TypeScript boilerplate focused on structure, logging, and maintainability.
